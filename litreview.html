	<h1>Mitgating Involuntary Personal Information Exposure On The Web</h1>

	<p>
		A large number of studies have investigated social networks and the social online footprint created by their users and thus the amount of personal information exposure. These studies for the most part agree that a large amount of exposure is not a good thing, however there are some that argue that having a greater footprint is somewhat a good thing (Ellison, Lampe & Steinfield, 2007). This study aims to highlight the main cause of information exposure: involuntary exposure.
	</p>

	<p>
		Irani, Li, Pu & Webb (2011) defined an online social footprint as “the total amount of personal information that can be gathered about an online identity by aggregating available social networks.” They further state that the most common set of data - birthdate, gender and location - poses the greatest risk of personal identification due to being able to identify around 87% of the American population.

		<h3>Involuntary Exposure</h3>
	</section>

	<p>
		Involuntary exposure is the most common form of personal information exposure because “most users assume that their profile information will be kept within the social network’s boundaries” (Irani et al., 2011; Chen & Lam, 2008). In addition, social networking sites guarantee the privacy of information within the site (Chen et al., 2008), but hackers, however, do not need to use any technical skills to combine the information from multiple social networks to build a profile. 
	</p>

	<p>
		With online social footprints getting larger, the risk of a personal identification attack will also increase. Many users do not just use one social network but a combination instead. Studies have shown that an attacker would be able to find over 40% of a person’s other social networking sites with just a pseudonym (Irani et al., 2011). The amount of information provided increases from 34 percent when using one site to 90 with six or more, they carry on to state. However, Irani, Li, Pu & Webb (2009) state that “a user with one social network reveals an average of 4.3 personal information fields, with this increasing to 8.25 for users with over eight social networks.”. The main concern is that most users provide truthful answers to these questions, providing hackers a rich source of information.
	</p>

	<p>
		On the contrary, Ellison et al. (2007) suggests that having a larger footprint is a good thing because it allows individuals to present themselves, express their views and establish or maintain connections with others. Chang et al. (2011) reinforces this by suggesting that social networking sites do not have only negative connotations, as these sites can be used for sexual health promotion. Ellison et al. (2007) further stated that social sites can be used for romantic relationship initiation which sites such as Tinder succeed at. Such relationship sites do however have a greater amount of personal information exposure with a higher concentration of information - more so than on social sites such as Facebook. This, again, increases the risk of personal identification attacks (Iran et al., 2011), with work for malicious users minimised. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Users do not just use social networking sites to meet friends or talk about themselves incessantly. As Ellison, Lampe & Steinfield suggest, some users may resort to online sites “for emotional support or understanding that they may not receive in their offline interaction.” Users may partake in social sites to foster relationship building by tracking other members of their community - this is known as social browsing or searching, they add. Social searchers would use the site to learn more about people with whom they share an offline connection, whereas social browsers use it to find people they would want to connect offline. In addition to this, both types of people may find themselves using the site to act as a warning for unsuitable behaviour within any groups they may be interested in. Resnick (2001) defined this as ‘peripheral awareness,’ which can “support one’s ability to remain aware of increasing large and diverse offline communities, thereby increasing social capital.”
	</p>

	<p>
		Social capital is a broad term that relates to resources accumulated through relationships. Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) define social capital as “the sum of the resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an individual or a group by virtue of possessing a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.” Social capital is a useful resource as it has been linked to an array of positive social outcomes, such as improved public health, lower crime rates and more efficient financial markets (Adler & Kwon, 2002). Greater social capital also means there is more information for malicious users to ‘mine’ and benefit from.
	</p>

	<h3>Mitigating Exposure</h3>

	<p>
		As stated previously, the risk of personal identification attacks is improved by the larger online footprint of network users (Irani et al., 2011). To mitigate this, users require a smaller footprint, but a lot of users have used social networking sites in the past and then stopped using them or forgotten their login information, preventing the minimisation process. Users that use these sites on a regular basis can set-up privacy controls, controlling exactly what the outside world can see.
	</p>

	<p>
		Irani et al. (2011) suggested that one method of making users aware of their footprint is to offer sites that allow them to check. The site would search for any profiles based on the information given and create an amalgamation of the results. This, however, could very easily be abused and misused by malicious users. Such a site like this would have to be offered as a tool by banking and credit bureaus or as a paid service (Irani et al., 2011).
	</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>

	<p>
		As social networks continue to grow, they pose a bigger risk to privacy. The biggest cause of personal information exposure is the user themselves - they choose to provide truthful answers to questions on social networking sites, thus making the pool of information larger, and by extension, their social footprint too. Users need to be made aware that putting more information about themselves online will increase their chances of being a victim of an attack. Users that use social networking sites to find offline connections or to meet people offline (previously referred to as social searchers and browsers) are increasing their own chances of being attacked by consistently using the sites.
