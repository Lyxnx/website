        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am currently a full time student studying BSc (Hons) Software Engineering at the University of Portsmouth, looking for a 
            placement during my third year, all while working part time for Sainsbury's. If you'd wish to get in touch, use my <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.

        <h2>First year</h2>
        <p>My first year was shared with Computer Science, Computing, Cyber Security, and Business Information Systems.
            This was to allow students to switch courses easily without requiring the first year to be redone. This year comprised of the following modules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python and Java</li>
            <li>Network fundamentals</li>
            <li>Computer Architecture </li>
            <li>Web foundations</li>
            <li>Databases</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Second year</h2>
        <p>Second year focusses more on reinforcing the fundamentals - some learnt in first year, some from personal experience 
            - while also learning more skills.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Structures and Algorithms - analyses data structures and efficiencies of various algorithms.</li>
            <li>Software Engineering Theory and Practice - focusses on everything from requirement gathering to actual development of software.</li>
            <li>Discrete Mathematics And Functional Programming - mathematical concepts relevant to software engineering, along with the use of Haskell.</li>
            <li>Ethical Hacking - one of my favourite modules - digs deeper into the core concepts of Linux and identifying vulnerabilities within a system.</li>
        </ul>
